Evolutionary computation and genetic algorithms (GA) in particular have been applied very successfully to many real world application problems. However, the success or failure of applying GA is highly dependent on how a problem is represented. Additionally, the number of free parameters makes applying these methods a science of its own, presenting a huge barrier to entry for beginners. This tutorial gave a summary on various representational aspects, discuss parametrization and their influence on the dynamics of GA.
