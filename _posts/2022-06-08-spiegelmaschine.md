The Spiegelmaschine project aims to provide an interactive model between painter and machine. The Spiegelmaschine is trained on 1000 paintings by [Steffen Terk](http://steffenterk.com/). 

An interface provides the ability to generate large numbers of random paintings that look like Steffen went into overdrive.
