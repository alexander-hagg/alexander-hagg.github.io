abstract = {The initial phase in real world engineering optimization and design is a process of discovery in which not all requirements can be made in advance, or are hard to formalize. Quality diversity algorithms, which produce a variety of high performing solutions, provide a unique chance to support engineers and designers in the search for what is possible and high performing. In this work we begin to answer the question how a user can interact with quality diversity and turn it into an interactive innovation aid. By modeling a user's selection it can be determined whether the optimization is drifting away from the user's preferences. The optimization is then constrained by adding a penalty to the objective function. We present an interactive quality diversity algorithm that can take into account the user's selection. The approach is evaluated in a new multimodal optimization benchmark that allows various optimization tasks to be performed. The user selection drift of the approach is compared to a state of the art alternative on both a planning and a neuroevolution control task, thereby showing its limits and possibilities.},

@article{Spieker2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Springer-Verlag Berlin HeidelbergMaximal covering location problems have efficiently been solved using evolutionary computation. The multi-stage placement of charging stations for electric cars is an instance of this problem which is addressed in this study. It is particularly challenging, because a final solution is constructed in multiple steps, stations cannot be relocated easily and intermediate solutions should be optimal with respect to certain objectives. This paper is an extended version of work published in Spieker et al. (Innovations in intelligent systems and applications (INISTA), 2015 international symposium on. IEEE, pp 1–7, 2015). In this work, it was shown that through problem decomposition, an incremental genetic algorithm benefits from having multiple intermediate stages. On the other hand, a decremental strategy does not profit from reduced computational complexity. We extend our previous work by including multi-objective optimization of multi-stage charging station placement, allowing us to not only optimize toward (weighted) demand location coverage, but also to include a second objective, taking into account traffic density. It is shown that the reachable part of the full Pareto front at each stage is bound by the solution that was chosen from the respective previous front. By careful choice of the selection strategy, a particular focus can be set. This can be exploited to comply with concrete implementation goals and to adjust the evolved strategy to both static and dynamic changes in requirements.},

abstract = {Evolutionary illumination is a recent technique that allows producing many diverse, optimal solutions in a map of manually de-.ned features. To support the large amount of objective function evaluations, surrogate model assistance was recently introduced. Illumination models need to represent many more, diverse optimal regions than classical surrogate models. In this PhD thesis, we propose to decompose the sample set, decreasing model complexity, by hierarchically segmenting the training set according to their coordinates in feature space. An ensemble of diverse models can then be trained to serve as a surrogate to illumination.},

abstract = {Neuroevolution methods evolve the weights of a neural network, and in some cases the topology, but little work has been done to analyze the effect of evolving the activation functions of individual nodes on network size, an important factor when training networks with a small number of samples. In this work we extend the neuroevolution algorithm NEAT to evolve the activation function of neurons in addition to the topology and weights of the network. The size and performance of networks produced using NEAT with uniform activation in all nodes, or homogenous networks, is compared to networks which contain a mixture of activation functions, or heterogenous networks. For a number of regression and classification benchmarks it is shown that, (1) qualitatively different activation functions lead to different results in homogeneous networks, (2) the heterogeneous version of NEAT is able to select well performing activation functions, (3) the produced heterogeneous networks are significantly smaller than homogeneous networks.},
