I am a nature-inspired researcher with a background in computer science, specifically interested in evolutionary computation, machine learning and creativity in engineering. I believe research in optimization should be broad, encompass uncertainty from the git-go, including the understanding that the iterative process of optimization includes changing requirements and constraints altogether. Optimization and machine learning can and should be used to further our understanding, not automate-away the human endeavour.

<b>Quality diversity</b> revolves around the idea that we want to find solutions that vary with respect to certain behavioral feature dimensions, just like nature does.

My <b>doctoral thesis</b> centers on cocreativity between human engineers and evolutionary and machine learning algorithms. I am most experienced with multisolution optimization methods like quality diversity, neuroevolution, and machine learning techniques like variational autoencoders and generative adversarial learning.

In the dissertation, I was able to generate large numbers of solutions to expensive optimization problems, most prominently in the fluid dynamics domain.


I take my inspiration from nature, real-world design problems, from computational fluid dynamics, the built environment, computational chemistry, and art.
