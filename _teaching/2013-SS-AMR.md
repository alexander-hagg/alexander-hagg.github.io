For six semesters I was a teaching assistant, leading the exercises on programming for autonomous mobile robots. Using the Robot Operating System, Python and C++, students implemented algorithms for such tasks as path finding in a simulated environment. Coming from various backgrounds, the course also offered the possibility to learn programming from scratch. A high intensity course for first semester students, including individual and group work.
